# Bevy Template

A simple template for getting started with Bevy projects.
The template comes with all the setup required to use the fast incremental compile for dev build.

To use, simply copy this template, edit `Cargo.toml` for your project details and the `README.md` file.
Additionally you may want to delete the `.git` and `git init .` a new git repo.
